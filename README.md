# Advanced CSS & SASS Course

I took this course as CSS and styling wasn't a topic covered during my 13 week coding bootcamp and I wanted to get a better understanding into CSS so I could create my own projects with style and elegance.

I have learned many valuable principles throughout this course including:
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- BEM
- SASS
- Advanced animations
- Basic design principles
- Responsiveness and breakpoints
- Media queires

I now feel much more confident when creating websites understanding these concepts more thoroughly. 

[Here is a link](https://mock-tours.netlify.app/) to a site I created while on this course, using flex instead of float shown on the course to make it more relevent.

I also went back and restlyed my final bootcamp project using BEM prinicples and SASS [here.](https://pojs.netlify.app/)
